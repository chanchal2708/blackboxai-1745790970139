# Smart Call Center Multimodal Speech Analysis System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that integrates multimodal speech analysis for smart call centers. The system analyzes voice and non-verbal cues such as tone, pitch, speech patterns, and facial expressions (if video is available) during customer interactions to enhance customer experience, improve service quality, and provide real-time insights.

## Features
- Audio analysis for tone, pitch, and speech patterns
- Video analysis for facial expression recognition
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for speech content analysis
- Machine learning models for real-time insights and predictions

## Installation
Install the required dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main application:

```
python main.py
```

## Future Work
- Implement detailed audio, video, and NLP analysis
- Integrate machine learning models for prediction and insights
- Develop real-time processing capabilities
